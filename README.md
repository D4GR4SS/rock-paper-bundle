# Rock, Paper, Bundle! 🪨 📄 ✂️

Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Bundle off-platform project! 🎉 In this project, we'll dive into the exciting world of Webpack and apply it to a finished Rock Paper Scissors game web app. 🚀

## Project Overview

This off-platform project is part of the Codecademy Front-End Path. Our goal here is not to add new features to the game but to enhance it by integrating Webpack. 🛠️ We'll be focusing on restructuring the project to use Webpack as a build tool to bundle our resources efficiently. 📦
